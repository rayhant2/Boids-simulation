# Boids-simulation
Boids is an artifical life program with a huge presence within computer graphics; originally developed by Craig Reynolds, it simulates emergent behavior for a population of objects. It specifies the behavior of each object individually instead of the whole collection. Defining a few rules for the individual objects, the program dynamically changes the positions and accelerations of each object to achieve a group "flocking" behavior.

## Overview

The Boids program simulates the movement of individuals, often represented as birds. Each individual, or "boid," follows a set of simple rules that results in emergent behaviors;
