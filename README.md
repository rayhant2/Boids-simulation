# Boids-simulation
Boids is an artifical life program, originally developed by Craig Reynolds, which simulates emergent behavior for a population of objects. It specifies the behavior of each object individually instead of the whole collection. Defining a few rules for the individual objects, the program dynamically changes the positions and accelerations of each object to achieve a group "flocking" behavior. This program has been used as a framework for computer graphics for many years, primarily movies. However, there are many more applications to this program like urban planning, crisis management, and more.
